<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p class="text"><strong>Critical Success Factors</strong>
<Br>
<strong>Clear Communication</strong> - The first foundation in excellent subcontractor management is clear, precise communication between the Sub and the Prime. Primes retain overall responsibility for the work and without precise, formal definitions of the work to be performed, there is risk of project failure. HCH Program Managers are responsible for ensuring that all subcontractor Task Orders are clear, concise and unambiguous.<Br><br>
In addition, AT THE PROJECT OUTSET, PMs are responsible for establishing the specific communication policies and procedures and in compliance with HCH&apos;s overall communication & visibility standards, so each subcontractor is fully aware of its obligations in this regard and has committed to them as part of each specific Task Order. 
Clear communication with standards of performance ensures that &quot;misunderstandings&quot; that can upset critical deliveries. Establishing standards of communication and visibility into projects and tasks through ongoing planning and reporting ensures that projects &quot;stay on track&quot;.
<br><br>
<strong>Data & Information</strong> - Once a subcontractor Task Order is in place, it needs to be monitored to ensure high quality. Some of that monitoring involves the communication discussed above, but other aspects are more data & information driven. Collecting and analyzing data related to professional services deliverables is critical to a Prime&apos;s ability to detect and correct problems before they have the potential to impact a project&apos;s overall success.
<Br><Br>
<strong>Subcontractor Control</strong>
<br>
In all cases, the HCH Program Managers supervise and QA subcontractor work, processes and performance. The PM will coordinate subcontractor work with the production work and ensure that all efforts are performed within schedule. Frequent monitoring of subcontractors is accomplished through the careful review of their progress at prescribed intervals. Subcontractors also submit progress reports as required, and with each invoice identifying current and projected work. If any problems are foreseen, HCH will ensure the Subcontractor is mitigating any risks and applying the necessary resources to ensure the problems are resolved to the satisfaction of the customer.
<br><Br>
Following Task Order award, a subcontractor Task Order will be awarded detailing their specific responsibilities, work quality, and technical requirements. When required, HCH arranges visits by the Supervisor to subcontractors&apos; facilities for the purpose of verification of products/deliverables produced by the subcontractors.
The PM ensures that the subcontractors submit progress reports monthly and with each invoice. The PM or his/her delegated representative reviews and signs the reports confirming agreement with the subcontractors stated progress. Progress reports submitted with final invoices are carefully reviewed by the PM, to ensure all requirements of the purchase order have been satisfactorily accomplished.
