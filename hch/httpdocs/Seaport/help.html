For the best hosting on the planet visit: <a href="http://allwebco.com" class="link">AllWebCo</a><BR>

<br>



<span class="subtitle">Step 1:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT COPYRIGHT:</b><br>
Open the "copyright.js" file in Notepad or any text editor, and change the "Your Company" and "info@yourdomain.com" lines to match your information. This will change the lower page info on all pages. Edit all ".js" files with a text editor.

<br><br>


<span class="subtitle">Step 2:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT CONTACT INFO:</b><br>
Open the "contact.js" file with Notepad or any text editor, and change the company name, address, phone number and e-mail address. This will change contact info on the "contact" page. This is done this way so search engines can't find your e-mail. You'll receive less spam.

<br><br>


<span class="subtitle">Step 3:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT FLASH ANIMATION:</b><br>
There are two flash animations in this template. One for the "intro" page (index.html), and one for all the other pages. To edit the flash contents: Open the "flash.txt" file and change the text that follows "logo=". This will change the logo on all the pages. Be sure not to delete the "logo=". Change the three "&line=" lines to catchphrases relating to your website. This will change the animation on the "intro" (index.html) page. You are limited with the length of the lines so be sure to test your webpage and make sure all the text fits. Change the text following "&slogan=" to add your slogan or phrase. You can also change the three "&intro" lines to alter the intro welcome text and enter button text.<br>

<br>
If you wish to use a graphic logo, there are instructions later in this document. 

<br><br>



<span class="subtitle">Step 4:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT THE CONTACT FORM:</b><br>
If you are setup with an AllWebCo hosting account. Go to your control panel at "http://your-domain.com/cgi-bin/plusmail" and install the free script "Formail" then edit the contact page and replace "your-domain.com" with your domain.<BR><BR>

If you are not set up with AllWebCo hosting or do not have "Formail" installed. You can either setup the contact form to use another contact script, install "Formail" on your server or you can remove the contact form from the pages between the comment tags.<BR><BR>


If you wish to change the sizes of the form elements you can open the "coolstyle.css" in Notepad or any text editor and change the ".shadeform" ".textarea" and ".dropdown" width numbers.

<br><br>



<span class="subtitle">Step 5:<BR></span>
<b>REPLACE THE GALLERY PICTURES:</b><br>
The best way to setup the pictures in the gallery is not to actually edit the HTML pages and change the pictures on each individual page. The fastest way is to simply replace the pictures in the "gallery" directory with your own by overwriting the files that are in there now and using the same generic names.<br><br>
In the "gallery" directory, replace the 18 "Fgallery" pictures with full size photos. Replace the 18 "gallery" pictures with your thumbnails. The thumbnails are now 100 x 70 pixels but you can make them any size that you prefer. There is info on the other pictures at this site later in this document.

<br><br>

<b>SIZE THE POP UP PICTURE VIEWER:</b><br>
The size of the pop-up window when you click a gallery picture for a close up is set at 625 x 450. You can change the size by editing the pop-closeup.js in Notepad. Look for "var view_width = 625" and "var view_height = 450" and edit with your sizes. Make the height large enough so the close button is displayed. You can also turn on the pop-up scrollbars. Change "scrollbars=0" to "scrollbars=1".

<br><br>


<span class="subtitle">Step 6:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT PAGES:</b><br>
Change the text on all pages to match your information. You can use a text editor like Notepad, Frontpage, Dreamweaver or any wysiwyg editor. Take care not to delete any of the HTML tags that surround the text. You will find notes inside each page to help you navigate. NOTE: You will not see the footer and header in some software because they are .js include files so you can globably edit the menus, your e-mail and other info.

<br><br>



<span class="subtitle">Step 7:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT PAGE TITLES, DESCRIPTIONS AND KEYWORDS:</b><br>
Open each of the pages and change the page titles (at the very top of the page) and also the description and the keywords to match your product or service. You can edit one page and copy and paste to the other pages. Be careful to only change what's inside the "" so you don't disturb the html code. Keywords are very important so your site will get a good listing at google or msn and other search engines.

<br><br>




<span class="subtitle">Step 8:<BR></span>
<b>UPLOAD:</b><br>
Upload the pages on to your hosting company's server using ftp software like <a href="http://cuteftp.com/" class="link">CuteFTP</a> or <a href="http://www.tucows.com/preview/195147.html" class="link">Coffee Cup</a> (free) or your control panel. Be sure to make a directory called picts on your server and put the pictures into that directory.



<br><br><br><br>


<span class="subtitle">Options:<BR></span>

<BR>

<b>USING A GRAPHIC LOGO:</b><br>
You can replace the Flash logo with a graphic logo. To do this, delete or rename the "header.js", then rename the "GRAPHIC_LOGO_header.js" to "header.js". In the picts directory you will find a graphic called "logo.gif". Edit this graphic with your logo. It's best to keep the graphic the same size it is now unless you edit the height and width numbers in the new "header.js".

<br><br>

<b>FONTS:</b><br>
You can change your font colors and sizes by editing the "coolstyle.css" with a text editor. <a href="http://allwebco.com/colors.html" class="link">You can find other font colors by clicking here</a>. You can also change the font sizes in the "coolstyle.css" text file. Change the "TABLE" px size to change the copy on all pages. Change the "subtitle" px size to change all the subtitle sizes.

<br><br>

<b>CHANGING / ADDING BUTTONS:</b><br>
You can change the names on the buttons like "About US" or "Contact" to other page names by editing the "menu.js". Only change the one instance of the name and not the name with the ".htm" after it. Whatever you change in the menu.js will change every page on the website. Keep the names reasonably short so you site remains less than 800 pixels wide. You can even add more pages but copying one button in the menu.js and pasting it right below the next. There are notes in the menu.js to copy and paste. Be sure to back up your file before you edit them.

<br><br>

<b>MOVING THE MENU ON THE PAGE:</b><br>
You can change the location of the menu buttons on the page. Open the "coolstyle.css" in a text editor and find this line: "#menu { RIGHT: 0px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 0px }" change the px numbers to move the menu to a different location.

<br><br>


<b>PICTURES:</b><br>
You can replace the pictures with your own. The pictures are now 200 x 100 pixels (except the gallery pictures) but you can use any size picture you want and the pages will size them to fit automatically. Each page has 3 pictures named according to the page they're on. You will find all pictures in the "picts" directory and all the gallery pictures in the gallery directory.


<br><br>

<b>ADDING PAGES:</b><br>
You can add pages to your website by copying and pasting any one of the pages and renaming it to whatever you need. You can then add links from the other pages or even add the page to the menu by opening the menu.js and copying and pasting one of the buttons below another. It's best to copy the two lines of the "contact" button and paste it between the other buttons. Be sure to back up your files before you edit them.


<br><br>



<b>SETTING UP YOUR SITE WITHOUT THE FLASH INTRO:</b><br>
If you don't want to use the flash intro and would rather have the front of your site be the "home" page. Open the "menu.js" in Notepad and change where it says "home.htm" (near the bottom) to "index.html". Then rename or delete the current flash intro page (index.html), then rename the "home.htm" to index.html.
